# Annotation Task

## 1) Does the post shows signs of fear or worry associated with the covid19 pandemic?


### How to annotate?


* Consider whether the post express explicit mention of feeling of nervous, restless or tense.
* Note that some posts maybe just for sharing a piece of information curated from other social media. Consider whether the author express feeling of nervous while explaining their reason to share this information.

### The Annotation will be one of the following:

#### level 0: no sign of corona-related anxiety or fear

	**Example:** 
	1. I came across this article from The Hill...not peer reviewed, but does utilize official data in its predictions. Thoughts on accuracy? I think folks with anxiety are just looking for a light at the end of the tunnel, and for many, that means a date for when things START to look better

	2. Do you think that people who had COVID19 and survived with no symptoms are lucky or will eventually have problems down the road, even if asymptomatic?


#### level 1: low corona-related anxiety or fear

	**Example:** (See highlighted sentence for )
	1. No matter what I do I’m always thinking about one if not all of these things.It seems so normal to me now, to feel this way. And *I’m worried it’s really starting to settle into my personality.* I don’t want this to be who I am when this pandemic is eventually over. I can’t even fathom what others are doing right now to bring themselves joy, I’m just at the point where I’m allowing myself to wallow.


#### level 2: high [or medium] corona-related anxiety or fear 
	
	**Example:** 
	My fiance works retail, and **I'm scared every single day that he could catch something while out there.** I work in the back of a medical clinic, but nearly nobody wears a mask, and I am so damn close to quitting that job because no one is taking any precautions.
	All this anxiety is getting to the best of me. I've been trying to hold strong for my family, for my fiance, and for my stepson, but I've been finding myself breaking down crying a lot as of late, always thinking of the worst-case scenarios. I find myself not sleeping much anymore because of the fear of, "What if I catch something? What if I bring it to my fiance, my stepson? What if I bring something home to my family?" *I am so, so, so scared. I'm trying not to cry as I type this.* I don't know how to handle this anxiety. I don't know what to do with my job either--I've brought it up to the HR manager, but she doesn't... believe in COVID, as much as others should.
